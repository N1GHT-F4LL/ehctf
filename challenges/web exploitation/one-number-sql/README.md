## Title description

Some one hides the flag in the database and only shows you a small part of the flag, but this does not affect your ability to get the flag, right~

## Question analysis

**Exposed port: `80`**

The injection point is at `len`, waf filters the numbers and requires that the numbers cannot be greater than 10 and less than 1

Splicing can be bypassed here. However, under normal circumstances, the flag found is in `result[1]`, and only `result[0]` will be output in the environment.

Therefore, you need to output only one row of sql, splice `where 'a'='b'` to block `result[0]`, so that `result[1]` will flow to `result[0]`

`-1) from flag where 'a'='b' union select flag from flag-- qwe`

Or, inserting `hex('a')+1` inside `substr` is also possible
